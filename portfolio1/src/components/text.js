               The Old Faitful Inn is an iconic and historical landmark located
               in the heart of Yellowstone National Park, directly next to the
               world-famous geyser Old Faitful. I had the privilege of working
               there in the summer of 2019.

               The Inn stands as a relic from another time, being nearly 120 years
               old at the time of this writing. Constructed under the architectural
               supervision of Robert Reamer back in 1904, the Inn was built using
               local pine trees and stones from a nearby geyser basin. The main lobby
               of the structure is massive and affords a view of the four interior balcony
               levels contained inside the building, though only the bottom two are open
               to the public for safety reasons.

               The Old Faithful Inn was added to the National Register of Historic Places
               in 1973, and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987. Truly, it
               is a relic to be treasured, and a must-see for anyone passing through
               Yellowstone National Park.
